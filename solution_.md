# Intepretation of the data
## Correlation Matrix
|Correlation Matrix|WO [x1000]|NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]|
|---|---|---|
|WO [x1000]|1|0.82|
|NL Beer consumption [x1000 hectoliter]|0.82|1|

From the above scatter plot and correlation matrix, we can observe that there is a positive correlation between the given two parameters. Additional data is required to determine the relation between the two parameters.
